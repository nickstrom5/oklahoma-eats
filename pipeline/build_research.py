"""Checks Oklahoma's hand-checked guide files (data/research/app/*.json) against the web build's places (site/oklahoma.json).

Oklahoma's research is written directly in data/research/app/*.json (one file per guide), each entry citing the 2025-26 page that names
it, read 2026-11-06: the Oklahoma Tourism Department's Oklahoma Catfish Trail brochure (June 2026), the Gulf Shores & Orange Beach
tourism board's Oyster Trail, Visit Mobile's "What to Eat in Mobile" (February 2026), Bham Now's dated lists, Oklahoma Living, Yellowhammer
News, Tasting Table's oldest-restaurant and oldest-bar lists (2025), the MICHELIN Guide and historical markers. Every cited host passed
check_sources.py. This script changes nothing: it reports each entry's kinds and whether a place of that name exists in its town in the
web build, and writes the names it can't find to data/research/app/LEADS.md (they stay out of the guides until they match).
Usage: ../.venv/bin/python build_research.py   (after oklahoma.py, before the app build)"""
